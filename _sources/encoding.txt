Encoding and Variance Partitioning Analysis
===========================================

Code for single electrode encoding and variance partitioning analysis. Stimuli were designed to independently vary intonation, phonetics, and speaker.
Encoding analyses are equivalent to three-way ANOVA with intonation, sentence, and speaker as the three factors. Each of these categorical variables
were coded as dichotomous variables using the simple coding method where regression weights can be interpreted as difference from a reference level of each categorical variable and the intercept 
is equal to grand mean over all trials.
