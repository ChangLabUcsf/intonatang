# Pitch information for TIMIT stimuli

The 499 text files in this directory contain pitch information for the TIMIT stimuli. Each file has three columns, time (s), pitch (Hz), and intensity (dB). A pitch value of 0 indicates that there was no voicing (and therefore no pitch) at that time point. The sampling rate for these measurements is 100Hz.
