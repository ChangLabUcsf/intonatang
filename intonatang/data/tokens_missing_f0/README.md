# Intonation missing f0, non-speech control tokens

Stimuli for the non-speech missing fundamental experiment. There are five subsets of stimuli. The first subset, files named "purr_stretch_0_[fe]male_st[1,2,3,4].wav", are the composition of the fundamental frequency (f0) and harmonics 2 and 3. All other stimuli contain "missing_f0" in their name and are the combination of the fourth, fifth, and sixth harmonics of the f0 contour. Three of the four missing f0 subsets have pink noise added 0.25 before pitch contour onset to mask energy at the fundamental frequency that may be introduced at the level of the cochlea. These files have "noise_first" in their names. Finally, the number following stretch indicates the amount the pitch range was changed by. A value of 0 means that the pitch range was not changed from the original contours. A value of 1 indicates that the pitch range was doubled, and a value of -0.5 indicates that that pitch range was halved. Each wav file ends with "_Z_stY", where Z is either “female” or “male” and Y indicates the intonation contour (1: Neutral, 2: Question, 3: Emphasis 1, 4: Emphasis 3).
