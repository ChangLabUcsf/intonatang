# Intonation speech tokens

Synthesized set of speech stimuli used in the main experiment that independently varies intonation contour, phonetic content, and speaker. Each individual wav file is named snX_stY_spZ.wav, where X is 1-4, Y is 1-4, and Z is 1-3. X indicates the sentence condition (sentence number or sn). Y indicates the intonation contour (sentence type or st). Z indicates the speaker (speaker or sp).
