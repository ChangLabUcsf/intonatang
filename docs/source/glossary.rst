        Pitch measured in absolute values across speakers. The default unit of measurement
        used is log Hz, but mel and erb units can also be used.

        Pitch values normalized by speaker. The method used to normalize absolute pitch values
        by speaker is z-scoring, relative pitch is measured in z-scores of log Hz by default.
